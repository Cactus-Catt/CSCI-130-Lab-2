2.	Write a program to calculate and display the area of a trapezoid. Allow the user to enter the values for a,b and h.
3.	Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. The program should then check if the number is greater than 1000. If the number is greater than 1000 it displays this is big.
4.	Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains the numbers from the user, then prints the larger number followed by the words “is larger.” If the numbers are equal, print the message “These numbers are equal.” Use only the single-selection form of the if statement.
